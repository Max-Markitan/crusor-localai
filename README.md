This method is relatively simple but does have some limitations. Composer might work inconsistently, but the core features, such as chat and other tools, function well. The key requirement is that your computer must have sufficient power to run local models. Iâ€™m continuing to explore and improve this method, and I plan to enhance the repository. If you have any ideas for improvement, Iâ€™d be happy to hear them!
